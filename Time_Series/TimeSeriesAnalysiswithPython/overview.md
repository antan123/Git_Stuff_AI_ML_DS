# Exercise

---

# 1. Time Series Exercise

### "Predict the number of tickets that will be raised in the next week"

- **Frame**: What to forecast? At what horizon? At what level?
- **Acquire, Refine, Explore**: Do EDA to understand the trend and pattern within the data
- **Models**: Mean Model, Linear Trend, Random Walk, Simple Moving Average, Exp Smoothing, Decomposition, ARIMA
- **Insight**: Share the insight through a datavis of the models

---

# 2. Text Analytics Exercise

### "Identify the entity, features & topics in the 'Comments' data or 'Twitter #machine learning' data"

- **Frame**: What are the comments you are trying to understand? 
- **Acquire, Refine, Explore**: Do Wordcloud, Lemmatization, Part of Speech Analysis, and Entity Chunking
- **Models**: TF-IDF, Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis
- **Insight**: Share the insight through word cloud and topic  visualisation

## Resources - Statistical Learning
- One of the good books on statistical learning is ISLR -> [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html)
- You can find all the ISLR code in python at this github repo - [https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python)

# Online Course
- Harvard Data Science Course - [CS 109 Course](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) (It is structured in similar way to the approach we shared)
- Data Science Specialisation - [JHU Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) (It is a good course, though the material is coded in R)
<br>
- Many more on Coursera & Udacity...
